# ACInterviewChallenge

Hello guys,

This repo is prepared for AC Interview Challenge.

## How it works

* It COLLECTS triggers from different Monitoring Systems in define INTERVALS. It can collect them by polling or they can push it into our system. It perpetually checks if TRIGGERS match. If yes then runs defined ACTION.

## How to install 

You have so many options:
* Run as a Docker image
* Download and install deb/rpm packages
* Clone it and run it Manually. Just run the "scr/main.py" file with Python.
